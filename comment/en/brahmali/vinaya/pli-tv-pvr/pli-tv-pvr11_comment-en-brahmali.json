Should it not be decided in this way?’ Saying, ‘Why did you not say this straightaway?’ he reopens that legal issue. In this way, the original doer reopens it.” ",

  "pli-tv-pvr11:32.1": "At first sight the Pali appears to be a straightforward declarative statement (“a legal issue arising from a dispute is a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business”), not a question. Yet this would mean that the next sentence is a direct contradiction to present one.

It may well be that at some point the whole text was supposed to be quoted. Yet, the way the text is presented now, with interspersed headings, it is natural to start the quote only after the final heading, which is here. In other words, it does not make sense to include the headings within the quotes. ",
