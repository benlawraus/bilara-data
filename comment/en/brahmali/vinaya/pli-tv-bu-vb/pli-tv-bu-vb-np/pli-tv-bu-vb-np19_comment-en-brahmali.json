Esa nayo sabbattha</i>, “In regard to ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ, etc., ʻWhat is meant for the headʼ means what goes to the head. In the books, however, it is written ʻ<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sīsūpaka</i>ʼ. This is a term for whatever is an ornament for the head. This is the method everywhere.” The basic meaning of the Pali word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpiya</i>, here rendered as “money”, is silver. We can infer from this that the ornaments mentioned in the commentary must be made of silver. The commentary suggests that gold is also included: <a href='/Sp.1.587/en/brahmali'>SP.1.587</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Rūpiyasaṃvohāranti jātarūparajataparivattanaṃ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Rūpiyasaṃvohāra</i> means exchanging gold and silver.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np19:2.66": "The commentarial explanation makes it clear that what is meant here is that one exchanges what is not money for money, that is, one is selling something and therefore ending up with money. <a href='/Sp.1.589/en/brahmali'>SP.1.589</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Attano vā hi arūpiyena parassa rūpiyaṁ cetāpeyya</i>, “One exchanges one’s own non-money for someone else’s money.” The same is true for the next two cases.
