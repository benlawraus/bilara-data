Often it refers to a requisite that has just been given to the Sangha or an individual monastic. Occasionally however, such as here, this does not fit the context. Here we need to assume that the monks had not yet received it, seeing as they ask the Buddha whether or not the robe is allowable. In other words, here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i> happens first, and only then is the robe given. The meaning, then, must be that the monks had been given an offer or a promise of this robe, but had not yet received it. In a sense, the robe had “become available” to them.
