  "mn6:2.1": "The “monastic code” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātimokkha</i>) is the primary list of rules for Buddhist monastics. There are many extant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātimokkhas</i> in Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit from early Buddhist schools, all similar but with some variations especially in minor rules of etiquette. Each fortnight the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātimokkha</i> is recited to affirm the communal values of the Saṅgha. Other passages are recited as inspiration, including this exhortation to keep the rules (also at <a href='/an4.12/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 4.12:1.1</a>, <a href='/an10.71/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 10.71:2.1</a>, and <a href='/iti111/en/sujato#2.1'>Iti 111:2.1</a>), as well as the verses known as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ovāda Pātimokkha</i> (<a href='/dn14/en/sujato#3.28.1'>DN 14:3.28.1</a>). | Commentaries offer several explanations for the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātimokkha</i>, favoring the sense “leading to release” (from remorse and suffering). The Buddha says he laid down the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātimokkha</i> to tie the community together like flowers bunched with string (<a href='/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#3.2.6'>Pli Tv Bu Vb Pj 1:3.2.6</a>), which suggests a connection with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭimukka</i>, “binding” (<a href='/mn38/en/sujato#41.11'>MN 38:41.11</a>).

  "mn6:4.1": "This series of arguments is conditional: <em>if</em> this is what you want, <em>then</em> this is how to get it. The Buddha is not encouraging people to want these things; on the contrary, he frequently warned of the dangers of such attachments. He is being pragmatic: given that people have desires, how can they be encouraged to desire something better? "
