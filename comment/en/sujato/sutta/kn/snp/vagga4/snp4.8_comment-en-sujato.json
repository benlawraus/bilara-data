  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for _subha_, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”.",
  "snp4.8:2.2": "_Dahanti_ is to “regard” or “see”, per Niddesa and Commentary; Bodhi’s “accuse” seems hard to justify.",
  "snp4.8:11.3": "Here, _yuga_ is connected in the Niddesa with _yugaggāha_ (“taking the reins”), which in turn is connected in Vb17 with “causing disputes”. It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”.",
  "snp4.8:11.4": "_Sakkhasi_ is 2nd future, _sampayātave_ is infinitive. _Sampāyati_ is a fairly common word, “answer a question”, usually in a negative sense, to be “stumped” by a question. Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro) don’t catch this sense."
