  "sn1.20:1.2": "on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at Tapodā monastery. ",
  "sn1.20:1.3": "Then Ven. Samiddhi, as night was ending, got up & went to the Tapodā Hot Springs to bathe his limbs. ",
  "sn1.20:1.4": "Having bathed his limbs and gotten out of the springs, he stood wearing only his lower robe, letting his limbs dry. ",
  "sn1.20:1.5": "Then a certain devatā, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entire Tapodā Hot Springs, went to Ven. Samiddhi. On arrival, while standing in the air, she addressed him with this verse: ",
  "sn1.20:2.1": "“Without having enjoyed (sensual pleasures), you go for alms, monk. ",

  "sn1.20:3.4": "Don’t let my time pass me by.” ",
  "sn1.20:4.1": "Then the devatā, coming down to earth, said to Ven. Samiddhi, ",

  "sn1.20:8.1": "“Monk, it’s not easy for us to go to the Blessed One, as he is surrounded by other devas of great influence. ",
  "sn1.20:8.2": "But if you go to the Blessed One and ask him this matter, I will come along to hear the Dhamma.” ",
  "sn1.20:8.3": "Responding to the devatā, “As you say, my friend,” Ven. Samiddhi went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there [he told the Blessed One his entire conversation with the devatā]. ",
