# Draft proposal for editions config

Here are some sample files for editions config. The entry point for every text is in `_publication-v2.json`. That is where the main shared data on each publication is found. Then the editions files give the specifics for each edition.

These give some idea what I am aiming for with these. 

**These are not final or tested or anything, just initial proposals! Change anything you like!**

`cip` by the way is "Cataloguing in Publication" data. This will be obtained from the National Library of Australia by a volunteer and added manually to the files.
