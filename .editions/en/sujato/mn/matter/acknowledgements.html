    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
    <p>Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation. My respects always for all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas: Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>
    <p>Special thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.</p>
